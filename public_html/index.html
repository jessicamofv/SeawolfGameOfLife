This page contains a JavaScript implementation of Conway's
Game of Life, which is not really a game, but a simulation. The
user may select different types of objects to put into the game
world and may start and pause the simulation as desired. Through
this assignment students should learn a bit about HTML5 controls, 
JavaScript, and rendering to the canvas. Students must make the
appropriate changes to this file and GameOfLife.js as needed
according to the HW 1 instructions.
